# Te-based-seebeck-coefficient-Prediction---XGBoost

Project focuses on predicting the Seebeck coefficient (S) of tellurium (Te)-based thermoelectric materials using machine learning techniques. Accurate prediction of Seebeck coefficients is essential for optimizing the performance of thermoelectric materials, which are widely used in energy conversion applications. Using a curated dataset of Te-based compounds, various ML models such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained and evaluated. Feature engineering was performed using tools like Matminer and Pymatgen to extract chemical, electronic, and structural descriptors. The best-performing model achieved high accuracy in predicting the Seebeck coefficient, demonstrating the potential of data-driven approaches in accelerating thermoelectric material discovery and analysis. Involvement of thermoelectric property is minimal.
